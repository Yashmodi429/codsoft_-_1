# Titanic Prediction Project

## Overview
The Titanic Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. This dataset contains information about passengers, such as their age, sex, ticket class, and more, which can be used to predict whether they survived or not.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model using classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on available features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It contains the following key features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Passenger name.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Inspect the data and handle any missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform descriptive statistics and visualize relationships between features.
   - Analyze correlations and determine feature importance.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing data (e.g., age, embarked).
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, embarked).
   - Normalize numerical features if necessary.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features based on the dataset (e.g., family size, title extraction).
   - Remove irrelevant or redundant features.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Compare models and select the best-performing one.

7. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on test data.
   - Submit predictions to Kaggle for evaluation if applicable.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.
  - `xgboost` or `lightgbm` for advanced modeling (optional).

## Results
The project aims to achieve high accuracy in survival prediction by leveraging feature engineering and model optimization techniques. Results will vary based on the models and features used.
